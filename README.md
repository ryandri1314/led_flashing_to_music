# LED Flashing to Music
In this project, I tried to make an LED strip and control it with 74hc595 IC. I wrote a small library for 74hc595 IC with some basic functions to set and flash the required number of LEDs. Then, I combined it with a sound sensor module to process the input data to make the LED strip flash automatically according to the volume of the environmental sound.
